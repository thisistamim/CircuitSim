## CircuitSim!

> A Interactive Electronic Circuit Simulator. It's a Circuit Simulator that runs in the Browser. It was originally written by Paul Falstad as a Java Applet. It was adapted by Iain Sharp to run in the browser using GWT, and here I just creating a React application that includes an iframe to display this Application :)
